this project represents a Polynom and Monom when each of them have functions that can be applied on them.
the class Monom represent a Monom from the shape a*x^b where: a(coefficient) is a real number and b(power) is a non-negative natural number,
and methods that perform manipulations on the monom such as:
add, subtract, multiply, derivative, f(x), copy, equals and toString.

the class Polynom represent a Polynom from the shape   a*X1^b + a*X2^b + .... + a*x(n)^b 
and functions that perform actions on the Polynom such as:
add, subtract, multiply, derivative, f(x), equals, isZero, root, copy, area, iterator and to string.
